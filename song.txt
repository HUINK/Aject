'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
